## About me

I am a Cloud Solutions Architect!
I am a DevOps Engineer!
I am an advocate for change!

I was a Security Architect, a Technical Account Manager, a Systems Engineer, a SysAdmin, a Network Engineer.
I've assumed roles like Project Manager, Release Manager, Release Engineer, SRE etc. because I had to and because I like change.
I like challenges and I like experiencing new stuff.

I like to design things, to piece together different technologies, to simplify complex designs and to solve problems.

I am mostly interested in things like:

* Cloud Computing
* Infrastructure Design
* DevOps with all the beauty and idiocy...
* Code Delivery Pipelines
* Making people happy
